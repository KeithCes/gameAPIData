# Game API Data
Within this repository there are APIs that use Flask and those that do not. The Flask server can be run from within the templates folder inside the flask folder. All files within allow for data pulling from a webpage and use the python as backend.

Outside of the flask folder are the local files. These allow for the pulling of data locally without the Flask client-server conneciton.
